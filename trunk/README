Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand. PrintDesign is oriented for prepress industry,

DETAILS

If you wish testing PrintDesign 1.0 you have two installation ways. 
First option is a distutils install with commands:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Application will be installed into /usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages
Also printdesign script will be in /usr/local/bin
But this way is not recommended. The most preferred option is a package 
installation (deb or rpm). You can create package using command:

python setup.py bdist_deb (for Ubuntu|Mint|Debian etc.)
python setup.py bdist_rpm (for Fedora|OpenSuse|Mandriva etc.)

By installing the package you have full control over all the installed files 
and can easily remove them from the system (it's important for application
preview).

For successful installation you need install UniConvertor 2.0 (you need to 
build this package yourself) and python-wxgtk2.8 packages before.
